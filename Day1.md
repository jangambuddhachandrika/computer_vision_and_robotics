# Image Formation : Pinhole camera

## Camera Obscura
We have a box with a hole in it and the back of the box is coated with photosensitive layer and when light passes through the hole an image is formed on the back.

Light illuminates the scene and strikes the object and reflectinons of the object  travels through through the pinhole and hits the back of the sensor(photo-sensitive layer) and we get literally an inverted image.
